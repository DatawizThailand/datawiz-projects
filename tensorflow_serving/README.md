# TensorFlow Serving

TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for
machine learning models, designed for production environments. It deals with
the *inference* aspect of machine learning, taking models after *training* and
managing their lifetimes, providing clients with versioned access via
a high-performance, reference-counted lookup table.
TensorFlow Serving provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models,
but can be easily extended to serve other types of models and data.

To note a few features:

-   Can serve multiple models, or multiple versions of the same model
    simultaneously
-   Exposes both gRPC as well as HTTP inference endpoints
-   Allows deployment of new model versions without changing any client code
-   Supports canarying new versions and A/B testing experimental models
-   Adds minimal latency to inference time due to efficient, low-overhead
    implementation
-   Features a scheduler that groups individual inference requests into batches
    for joint execution on GPU, with configurable latency controls
-   Supports many *servables*: Tensorflow models, embeddings, vocabularies,
    feature transformations and even non-Tensorflow-based machine learning
    models

## Serve a Tensorflow model in 60 seconds
```bash
# Download the TensorFlow Serving Docker image and repo
docker pull tensorflow/serving

git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/serving
# Location of demo models
TESTDATA="$(pwd)/serving/tensorflow_serving/servables/tensorflow/testdata"

# Start TensorFlow Serving container and open the REST API port
docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 \
    -v "$TESTDATA/saved_model_half_plus_two_cpu:/models/half_plus_two" \
    -e MODEL_NAME=half_plus_two \
    tensorflow/serving &

# Query the model using the predict API
curl -d '{"instances": [1.0, 2.0, 5.0]}' \
    -X POST http://localhost:8501/v1/models/half_plus_two:predict

# Returns => { "predictions": [2.5, 3.0, 4.5] }
```
